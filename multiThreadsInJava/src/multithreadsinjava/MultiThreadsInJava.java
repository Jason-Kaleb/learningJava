    multithreading = process of executing multiple threads simultaneously
                     Helps maximum utilization of CPU
                     Threads are independent, they dont affect the execution of other threads
                     An exception in one thread will not interrupt other threads
                     useful for servicing multiple clients, multi-player games, or other mutually independent tasks
